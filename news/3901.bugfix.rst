Now the `pipenv run` manage the presence of environment variables in the command (e.g. `hello=world python --version`).
At the moment this will NOT manage:
    - Multiple commands execution separated by `;`, `|`, `&&`, `||`.
    - The resolution of any existing defined environment variable (e.g. `hello=$world python --version` won't be resolved and will be treated as `hello='$world' python --version`)
    - Environment variables setting on Windows based shell
